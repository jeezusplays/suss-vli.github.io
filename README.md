version: v0.1.0.alpha1

# TODO

- [] Generate a frontpage for VLI
- Regarding the student guide for interactive lab guide by VLI + Github Classroom
  - [] Bigger Gif?
  - [] Gif for two platforms: window and mac. We are only supporting generally window and mac
  - [] Test the workflow
  - [] Setup CI/CD such that the pdf, html and other versions are auto-generated via each commit
  - [] Introduce semantic versions e.g v1.0.0 to track changes
  - [] Jane suggested using video instead of Gif
  
This may be the best meme to [explain](https://twitter.com/PR0GRAMMERHUM0R/status/1561247203443752960) git to anyone


## Conclusion
- Use Git for step by step animated image
- Use mp4 for an overall start to end demostration
Idea: To have an interactive guide that encourage self-help

- Consider using https://github.com/ines/termynal to animate the temrinal for the lab author's guide

Version: v0.1.0.alpha1

# TODO

- [x] Generate a frontpage for VLI
- [x] Introduce semantic versions e.g v1.0.0 to track changes
- Regarding the student guide for interactive lab guide by VLI + Github Classroom
- [] Bigger Gif?
- [] Gif for two platforms: window and mac. We are only supporting generally window and mac
- [] Test the workflow
- [] Setup CI/CD such that the pdf, html and other versions are auto-generated via each commit
- [] Jane suggested using video instead of Gif
- Use Git for step by step animated image
- Use mp4 for an overall start to end demostration
Idea: To have an interactive guide that encourage self-help
- Consider using https://github.com/ines/termynal to animate the temrinal for the lab author's guide
- Use this for the frontpage https://startbootstrap.com/previews/business-frontpage

This may be the best meme to [explain](https://twitter.com/PR0GRAMMERHUM0R/status/1561247203443752960) git to anyone

# Regarding Frontpage
- [] add an animation to the header
- [] change the call-to-action button to respond correctly to mobile view
- [] add a page to call for interns & software engineers (devops, full-stack & data science) & craftmen and craftwomen for VLI project

2. *Command line*

In the future, we will be adopting Git and Github classrooms. We will announce the plan  & schedule later. 
For instructors, you can also use the following `clone` command to get the entire repo.
This assumes you have git installed and set up. 

git clone https://github.com/suss-ict239/jul2022tma

3. *Github Desktop*

Last but not least, I highly recommend using github desktop. It makes cloning and editing on git so much easier. 


4. If you want to master git in preparation for Github classroom, I highly recommend following the official skills github page https://skills.github.com/ 

Feel free to let me know if you have questions.
